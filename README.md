# Mode-choice-data-analysis
The useful codes and experience for mode choice analysis for the questinare data.

## The useful information includes:  
1. Data preprocessing
   - Data relabelling: one-hot encoding, discrete relabelling.
   - Missing value analysis.
   - Data reconstruction.
2. Data science models
   - Data process: normalization methods & PCA
   - Model selction and validation  
    - For the same model form with different hyper-parameters: SVM, Logit
    - For different forms: using the selection tool in scikit-learn
    - Ensemble learning and cross-validation
